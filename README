Architecture:

Express HTML: Express.js with HTML templating is suitable for generating dynamic web pages on the server-side. It's efficient for content-focused applications like those catering to customers where initial load time is crucial.

JavaScript: JavaScript is utilized both on the frontend and backend. On the frontend, it's used for client-side scripting to enhance user interactions and UI behaviors. On the backend, Node.js enables server-side scripting, allowing for non-blocking, event-driven functionality.

Single-Page Application (SPA): SPAs, implemented with Angular in this project, provide a more interactive and seamless user experience. They load the entire application upfront and then dynamically update content without page reloads, suitable for feature-rich interfaces like the administrator dashboard.

Backend with MongoDB:

MongoDB was chosen for the backend due to its flexibility and scalability, which aligns well with the unstructured nature of data typically associated with travel bookings and reviews. It allows for easy adaptation to changing data requirements and offers faster performance compared to traditional SQL databases for certain use cases.
Functionality:

JSON vs. JavaScript: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data interchange format, while JavaScript is a programming language. JSON serves as a bridge between the frontend and backend by facilitating data exchange in a standardized format that can be easily parsed by JavaScript.

Refactoring for Efficiency: Refactoring code involves restructuring existing code to improve its functionality, readability, or performance. By refactoring code in the full stack application, you can enhance maintainability, reduce duplication, and improve overall efficiency. Utilizing reusable UI components allows for consistency in design, faster development, and easier maintenance across the application.

Testing:

API Testing: Various methods such as unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing are employed to ensure the proper functioning of API endpoints. This involves testing each endpoint's behavior under different scenarios and verifying that it returns the expected responses.

Security Considerations: Testing with added layers of security involves ensuring that authentication and authorization mechanisms work as intended, and sensitive data is protected. This may include testing for vulnerabilities such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

Reflection:

This course has equipped me with practical knowledge and skills in full stack development, including frontend and backend technologies, database management, and security considerations.
I've learned to design and develop scalable, secure, and efficient web applications using modern technologies like the MEAN stack.
Mastery of these skills makes me a more marketable candidate in the field, as I can contribute effectively to projects requiring end-to-end development expertise, from UI/UX design to backend architecture and deployment.
